# JavaScript Learning

This folder contains my JavaScript journey.  
You'll find structured notes, exercises, and mini-projects.

## Structure

- `/notes/` – Topic-based notes and explanations
- `/exercises/` – Practice problems and solutions
- `/projects/` – Small JavaScript projects and experiments

## Getting Started

Check out the `notes` folder for the latest concepts I'm working on, or dive into `exercises` to see coding practice in action!
