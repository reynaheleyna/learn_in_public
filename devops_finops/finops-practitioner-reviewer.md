## What is FinOps

FinOps is an operational framework and cultural practice which maximizes the business value of cloud and technology, enables timely data-driven decision making, and creates financial accountability through collaboration between engineering, finance, and business teams.

Portmanteaou of Finance and DevOps - business and engineering.

FinOps is about **getting the most value out of cloud to drive efficient growth**.

80% of organizations will overshoot IaaS [Infrastructure as a Service] budgets due to a lack of cloud cost optimization governance and misguided upfront spend commitments. - DevOps.com

"A successful FinOps practice expands and accelerates the business benefits made possible by cloud. Since then, the practice of FinOps is increasingly being applied to IT spend in addition to public cloud (what we refer to as Cloud+)... Investment in FinOps leads to better financial management of cloud services. This ensures cloud initiatives deliver measurable business value, and each of these value-driven initiatives gives the cloud value flywheel another push." 

## FinOps Framework

Business + Technology 
Scopes - Context for Practitioners to Adopt the framework
Core Personas are always engaged in a FinOps Practice (Engineering, Practitioner, Finance, Leadership, Procurement, Product)
Allied Personas Support a FinOps Practice (ITFM, ITAM, ITSM, Security, Sustainability)

Domains - outcomes of a FinOps practice
Capabilities - describes how to achieve domains

### Principles
- Teams need to collaborate
- Business value drives technology decisions
- Everyone takes ownership for their technology usage 
- FinOps data should be accessible, timely, and accurate 
- FinOps should be enabled centrally
- Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud. 

### Phases
- Inform (visibility and allocation)
- Optimize (rates and usage)
- Operate (continuous improvement and usage)
(https://www.finops.org/framework/phases/)


### Domains with its Capabilities
https://www.finops.org/framework/domains/ and https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/ 


Domains are outcomes of the FinOps practice. 

##### Understand Usage and Cost
- Data Ingestion 
- Allocation

- Anomaly Management

##### Quantify Business Value
- Planning and Estimating
- Forecasting
- Budgeting
- Benchmarking
- Unit Economics


#### Optimize Usage and Cost

### Personas
Personas represent categories of stakeholder groups that must collaborate to perform FinOps successfully, not just individual people. In a complex organization, a Persona may represent many people in various related roles. In smaller organizations, a single person may perform the duties of multiple Personas. 

https://www.finops.org/framework/personas/ 

#### Core Personas
- FinOps Practitioner
- Leadership
- Product
- Engineering
- Finance
- Procurement

#### Allied Personas
-ITSM/ITIL
- ITAM
- Sustainability
- Security
- ITFM / TBM

### Maturity Model
- Crawl
- Walk
- Run 

Gallâ€™s law tells us that complex processes that work have evolved from simple processes that work; they are not designed from scratch. Do not attempt to build full solutions, rather, build only the amount of solution that you need in any given case.

### Tools
FinOps Tool refers to any of the cloud provider or third-party software packages that support any of the FinOps Capabilities.
FinOps Service refers to a third-party service that delivers outcomes related to the FinOps Capabilities.

Types of Tools
- Cloud Provider Cost Management Tools Native
- FinOps Platform and Tooling (critical abstraction layer between you and the regularly changing landscape of multi-cloud billing data.) 
- Homegrown Tooling (built from scratch but often built on top of existing business intelligence)

## Adopting FinOps

3 Ways: 
- Leadership Mandate (leader instruction)
- Grassroots Adoption (ranks then formalizes)
- Individual Initiative (FinOps team and practice)

Research > Propose > Prepare > Launch

### Stage 1: Research 

A. Cloud Procurements and Use
- Collcting inputs on cloud spend
- Azure Usage and Charges
- Metered Service Usage and Charges

B. Cloud Hierarchy and Tagging Data
- Azure resources and management hierarchy
- AWS and GCP Tagging
- OCI Tagging

C. Review Current Rates (Baselining) and Spending Trends (Short-term Forecast until time series data is complete)

D. Cloud Workloads Usage
- terminating idle resources
- power scheduling
- rightsizing resources

E. Compute FinOps KPIs 
- FinOps KPI Library
- FinOps Foundation Training

F. FinOps Champions 
- Finance
- Engineering
- Procurement
- Product Team
- Leadership

### Stage 2: Propose

- Produce a deck and get colleagues on board
- Key stakeholders to be tapped and consulted
- Clarify CTA (Agreement/Approval, Funds, Human Resource, Support, etc.)
