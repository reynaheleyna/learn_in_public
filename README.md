# Learning in Public

Welcome to my "Learning in Public" repository!  
Each topic has its own folder with notes, code, and resources.

## How this Started 
I have a friend named Bituin (CX, UX, and tech-powered fitness initiatives expert) and some acquaintances from the awesome Chrome extension application Glasp (Kei and Kazuki) who have been using Learning in Public for years. These advocates inspired me heavily but I never really acted on it up until recently, when I had a life changing diagnois in the brain. I figured that I really need to do things that spark joy to me and not mince words, actually mean them, and do what we can to make a difference to the world no matter how small. 

While I have a Glasp account with a good following of my widely read articles across various topics, email subscriptions, and a giant collection of online courses in Coursera, FreeCodeCamp, Udacity, Udemy, and O'Reilly, I find that I work best synthesizing multi-disciplinary stuff and writing about it. I only had the courage to finally build this repository after I was (also just as luckily) able to build a tiny community of learners in the LIP (Learn in Public) and Ship Discord server. We have daily checkins for accountability and I use this repo to version my progress and use Git commits as logs of how I progressed in my L.I.P. commitment daily. 

I also hope that people who need to take certifications for the topics I am learning may find this evolving repo as a valuable resource for reviewing. Whenever I break into a new niche of technology, I double my joy when someone else is able to benefit from my documentation or notes.
