> **Learning in Public** (LIP) is my daily commitment to explore and share knowledge across modern tech: JavaScript frameworks, Python data viz, DevOps & FinOps pipelines, cloud-native stacks, and more. All notes, code snippets, and reflections live here.

## 🌱 Why “Learning in Public”?

I believe that:
- **Sharing accelerates growth**: Teaching or documenting what I learn (Node.js, Streamlit, Terraform, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, SQL, etc.) helps me internalize concepts and benefits others.
- **Community fuels motivation**: The LIP & Ship Discord community keeps me accountable. Daily check-ins, feedback loops, and collective curiosity spark new experiments.
- **Multidisciplinary synthesis**: My strength lies in weaving data analytics, technical writing, UX thinking, and cloud engineering into cohesive insights. This repo is a live journal of that journey.

> “If a concept stays in your head, it rarely changes the world. But if you document it—even a small script or a markdown note—it can light someone else’s spark.”  

I was deeply inspired by the example of Glasp founders Kei and Kazuki and my close friend Bituin Callanta who have been heavy advocates of learning in public. My accountability buddies Marielle and Djana also make sure that my many interests turn into things and actual results.

## 🛠 Tech Focus & Keywords

I’m actively exploring and sharing in these areas (but not limited to):
- **Frontend & JavaScript**: React, Vue, Nuxt.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Gatsby, Hugo 
- **Backend & APIs**: Node.js (Express, Fastify), Python (Flask, FastAPI), Streamlit visualizations, serverless functions
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Docker, Kubernetes basics, Terraform, Azure DevOps pipelines, AWS CDK, Azure ARM
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Azure (App Service, Static Web Apps, Functions), Atatic hosting for Gatsby/Hugo, reverse-proxy with Nginx
- **Data & Databases**: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), data modeling, data cleaning scripts in Python (pandas), Power BI / open-source dashboards, site analytics
- **Documentation & “Docs-as-Code”**: Markdown, MkDocs, Docusaurus, Ghost/Gatsby frontends, technical writing best practices, knowledge management
- **DevOps Governance & FinOps**: Basic security hygiene (CORS, headers), cost-monitoring strategies, cloud spend optimization, observability
- **Soft Skills & Growth**: Mindfulness for developers, NLP techniques for focus, career reflections, public speaking tips (?) 

You can find a smattering buffet of tech tools here depending on what I need at work and in my personal projects: 
`#JavaScript`, `#NodeJS`, `#Streamlit`, `#Docker`, `#Terraform`, `#Azure`, `#CI/CD`, `#SQL`, `#DevOps`, `#FinOps`, `#Markdown`, etc.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each topic gets its own folder. Within, you’ll likely find a README with quick navigation, code samples, exercises, and links.



- **Each subfolder’s README.md** explains prerequisites, commands (e.g., `npm install`, `streamlit run`, `hugo server`), and learning goals.
- **Code samples** use clear naming and often include comments about why choices were made (e.g., “using GitHub Actions for CI/CD to deploy a Next.js app to Azure Static Web Apps”).
- **Commits as logs**: I commit frequently, using commit messages that reflect daily progress (e.g., “feat: add initial Terraform script for Azure Function deployment” or “docs: draft notes on SQL indexing strategies”).

## 🎯 How to Use This Repo

1. **Browse by Topic**  
   - Start with `/javascript/README.md` if you’re exploring JS frameworks, or `/python/README.md` for data viz. Each README points to deeper experiments.
2. **Follow Along / Fork**  
   - Fork or star this repo. Clone locally and check out code samples. Run demos in Docker or local environments.
   - Example:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-in-public.git
     cd learning-in-public/devops_finops
     # Try Terraform: cd terraform-azure && terraform init && terraform plan
     ```
3. **Contribute & Collaborate**  
   - I kept this public for updates since tech is ever changing and ephemeral. Found an outdated note? Submit a PR with updates (e.g., newer Streamlit version changes, updated Azure CLI commands).
   - Suggest new topics via Issues (e.g., “Add example: deploying Streamlit on Azure Container Instances”).
4. **Daily/Weekly Check-ins**  
   - I use GitHub commits as my LIP log: small, meaningful commits like “chore: update Python dependencies for Streamlit demo” or “refactor: reorganize Hugo folder for new theme test”.
   - In `/reflections/` I maintain retrospectives: lessons learned about learning public workflows, time management with 30-minute daily slots, or thematic reviews (“April 2025: CI/CD deep dive”).
5. **Certification Prep**  
   - If you’re studying for an exam, check relevant folders for curated notes, practice questions, and cheat sheets.
6. **Stay Updated**  
   - I tag Day X on commits but once I have curated enough data, I will formalize releases of study packets. 
   - Watch this repo to get notifications on updates or new topics.

## 📈 Tracking Progress & Metrics

- **Commit cadence**: aim for small daily commits (30-minute learning sessions).  
- **Issues & PRs**: track topics you plan to cover; tag them with labels like `enhancement`, `tutorial`, `demo`.  
- **Milestones**: group related topics (e.g., “DevOps Fundamentals”, “Data Visualization with Streamlit”), then close milestone when folder/readme is mature.  
- **Analytics**: optionally integrate GitHub Pages or a static viewer to show “topics covered” badge or “days since start” badge.

## 💡 Tips for Fellow LIP Enthusiasts

- **Start small**: a single markdown note or simple “Hello World” example in your chosen tech is progress.  
- **Document decisions**: why choose Azure Static Web Apps vs. Netlify? Note pros/cons in README.  
- **Use “docs-as-code” practices**: store notes in Git, review via PRs, version releases when a topic is “complete enough.”  
- **Automate**: set up GitHub Actions to lint Markdown (`markdownlint`), run Python formatting (`black`), or deploy a preview site for docs (e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify preview for Hugo demos).  
- **Reflect**: add a short entry in `/reflections/` after each week: what worked, what felt challenging, what to tackle next.
- ** Grab a study buddy **: This never fails! That's why I built the LIP and Ship Community.
