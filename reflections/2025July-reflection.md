# July 2025 Learning in Public Reflections
Updated July 23, 2025 in between data janitoring tasks

I went back to an old tried and tested way of upskill and this is by way of MOOCs. I realized that I need not reinvent the wheel when it comes to how I can maximize my learning. At night I removed my iPhone from the bedroom and replaced it again with my Kindle device where I read until I fall asleep, and restricted the inbox checks in keeping with Cal Newport's work ethic on Deep Work book.


Learning Paths for July: 
1. For this month I began revisiting my SQL allergy with the IBM Data Architecture MOOC (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-architect)
2. Streamlit in Build-Centric Fashion for Dashboarding my Python cleaning efforts. 
3. FinOps Analytics Basics 
4. Advice from a Finance Expert (via Linkedin free consult) about my bridging of Finance learning for my FinOps and FOCUS dataset upskill.

It's been almost 7 days and I feel the structure has helped me tremendously but I coupled it with real-life building of applications instead of just ingest books and data like cookie monster does with cookies.
