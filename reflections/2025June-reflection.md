# June 2025 Learning in Public Reflections 

I was not very organized last month. The learning plan felt a bit scatter-brained so I did a regroup and refocused on working through a good structure. I decided to pivot to relearning with 50% theory and 50% build on the daily for the 20 minutes I allocated. 

For June 2025, I showed up for myself for around 13 days: 
- I gained a FinOps practitioner certification and got plugged in the FinOps Asia wider community. 
- I continued to buddy up with Sunehra on the LIP Discord channel. There's 28 of us but some are intermittent in showing up, but that's perfectly okay. 
- I experimented for the 13 days until I eventually followed a structured MOOC instead of rogue it with a daily build as needed in keeping with JIT (just in time) approach that I learned from Tiago Forte years ago. 

I still hold the biggest lesson I've learned jobs ago: I am the one responsible for my own intellectual stimulation or upskill. No job or affiliation will provide that for me as adequately as I can give that to myself.
